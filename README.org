A tron-like game would be great for the N9.  I plan on:

1) getting armagetron or glTron running on the N9 (preference for armagetron[1])
2) release (early, often)
3) as many N9-specific patches as practical: 
   3a) integration with N9 accelerometer
   3b) simple integration with N9 touch screen
   3c) camera snapshots for personalisation
4) any other patches as suggested by community

Footnotes:
1. Previously glTron has been packaged for the n900 but armagetron would offer more benefits (e.g., multiplayer), though the OpenGL library might be a problem.
